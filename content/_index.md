_The fifth is Glaðsheimr,
    and gold-bright there
 Stands Valhöll stretching wide;
  And there does Oðinn
   each day choose
The men who have fallen in fight._

# Vision

Glaðsheimr is an open project to research building complete applications that are capable of providing true privacy and transparency to end users. [Research]({{< relref "/docs/research" >}}) is focused on developing use cases and employing technologies such as [TinyML](https://tinymlsummit.org/), FGPAs and concepts of orchestration. Glaðsheimr will also be develop tooling ([Mjolnir](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/mjolnir)) to allow application developers to design, build and orchestrate applications. 

## Dev Tooling Goals: Orchestration

Orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual components (models, sensors, frontend)
within multiple devices. Orchestration automates such things as configuration, availability, provisioning and health monitoring of the application.

Orchestration is a common concept in web development (with projects such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)) although the scope for orchestration in [Mjolnir](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/mjolnir).  


## Proof Of Concepts

1. [Vant](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/csa-vant): Does your water intake increases morning energy?
   1. Water tracking: Audio signals based on poured water
   2. Person energy: Time spent in bed tracked with human presence or sleep tracking 
   3. Integration using only bluetooth mesh protocols
2. Another concept is built around exploring metabolic syndrome
