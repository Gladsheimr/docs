_The fifth is Glaðsheimr,
    and gold-bright there
 Stands Valhöll stretching wide;
  And there does Oðinn
   each day choose
The men who have fallen in fight._

## Orchestration for Devices

Glaðsheimr is an open project to explore orchestration of complete stack applications on endpoint clouds. 
Orchestration allows building applications that are self contained and resilient as clouds that run close to their data
and application in the real world.
