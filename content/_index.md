_The fifth is Glaðsheimr, \
    and gold-bright there \
 Stands Valhöll stretching wide; \
  And there does Oðinn \
   each day choose \
The men who have fallen in fight._

# Vision

Glaðsheimr is an open project to research building complete applications that are capable of providing true privacy and transparency to end users. [Research]({{< relref "/docs/research" >}}) is focused on developing use cases and technologies that leverages concepts such as [TinyML](https://tinymlsummit.org/), FGPAs and concepts of orchestration. Glaðsheimr will also be develop tooling ([Mjolnir](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/mjolnir)) to allow application developers to design, build and orchestrate applications. 

## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual components (models, sensors, frontend)
within multiple devices. Orchestration automates such things as configuration, availability, provisioning and health monitoring of the application.

Orchestration is a common concept in web development (with projects such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)) although the scope for orchestration in [Mjölnir](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/mjolnir).  


## Proof Of Concepts

1. [Vatn](https://github.com/Gladsheimr/csa-vatn): Does your water intake increases morning energy?
   1. Water tracking: Audio signals based on poured water
   2. Person energy: Time spent in bed tracked with human presence or sleep tracking 
   3. Integration using only bluetooth mesh protocols
2. Another concept is built around exploring metabolic syndrome
